# Code review and pair programming exercise

* Collaborate with your partner through microsoft teams or any other medium.
* Create a simple DApp or Web App Idea

* Divide your project into features(Make sure each developer works on at least one feature)

* One of the developer would go ahead and create a public repository in either github or bitbucket. Invite your peer to collaborate with repo.

* Both the developers can start working on Idea in separate feature branches.

* Once you are done with feature; create a pull request, let it pass the build in jenkins, let your peer review the code and merge the pull-request to the master branch if stuff works fine.

* Make a submission to the [blackboard](https://bb-gbc.blackboard.com/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_5078161_1&course_id=_184318_1&group_id=&mode=cpview) with repository URL.(One submission per group).

**Note** : Groups will **NOT** be same as scrum teams.
